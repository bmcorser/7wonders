Things I didn't like
--------------------

    - Module definition is not really there; relies on ``(function(){})();``
      closures; we'll still need to use RequireJS/Browserify/CommonJS
    - Damn this is ugly
    - So many wheels reinvented; Google NIH syndrome?
    - Terminology is confusing because it is *confused* (ex. "services",
      ``.when``)
    - Feels like it's designed to build one type of app (maybe that's the
      "Angular Way")

Things I kind of liked
----------------------

    - Promotion of HTML to programming language, with ``<div>`` as a primitive
    - With debug dist, tracebacks are not unreasonable
    - Built in fun, like ``$cacheFactory``
