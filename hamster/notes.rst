Groovy
------

    - Chrome extension looks impressive
    - ``ember-data`` looks promising
    - ember-cli_ looks promising

Not so groovy
-------------

    - HBS syntax is pig ugly
    - Docs are for Ruby people, "hash" instead of "object"
    - Scratch that, it's Ruby `all the way down`_
    - This is a transition period_?
    - Configuration by convention extends to server config. A joke, surely?
    - ``ember-data`` still in beta
