Groovy
------

    - Chrome extension looks impressive
    - ``ember-data`` looks promising
    - ember-cli_ looks promising

.. _ember-cli: https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli

Not so groovy
-------------

    - jQuery!?
    - HBS syntax is pig ugly
    - Docs are for Ruby people, "hash" instead of "object"
    - Generally things appear to be somewhat unidiomatic, are we writing Ruby
      or JS here?
    - This is a transition period_?
    - Configuration by convention extends to server config. A joke, surely?
    - ``ember-data`` still in beta, integrating with crudpile will be a chore
    - The "Ember Way", `case in point`_.
