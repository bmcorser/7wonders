Groovy
------

    - Chrome extension could be useful
    - ember-cli_ gives ES6 modules

.. _ember-cli: https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli

Not so groovy
-------------

    - jQuery >:(
    - HBS syntax is pig ugly
    - Docs are for Ruby people, "hash" instead of "object"
    - Generally things appear to be somewhat unidiomatic, are we writing Ruby
      or JS here?
    - This is a transition period_?
    - Configuration by convention extends to the backend!?
    - ``ember-data`` still in beta, integrating with crudpile will be a chore
    - The "Ember Way", `case in point`_.
    - Caremad about some stuffs? (``extends``, etc)
